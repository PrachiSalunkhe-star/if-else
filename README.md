# Larest Number

in Python, the if-else statement is a fundamental control flow structure used for decision-making. It allows a program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a given condition is True or False. 

>Syntax :-
      if condition:
    # Code block to execute if the condition is True
      else:
    # Code block to execute if the condition is False

>Explanation:
  if condition:-
  The if keyword initiates the conditional statement. condition is a boolean expression that evaluates to either True or False. A colon (:) must follow the condition.
  else:-
  The else keyword provides an alternative code block to execute if the condition in the if statement evaluates to False. A colon (:) must follow else.
